# AI Virtual Mouse Using Hand Gestures

This project is a machine learning-based application that allows users to control their computer mouse using hand gestures. By leveraging computer vision techniques and deep learning models, the application recognizes hand movements and translates them into mouse controls, providing an innovative way to interact with your computer.

## üåü Features

- Control mouse movements using hand gestures
- Perform left-click and right-click actions
- Works on any computer with a camera
- User-friendly interface
- Open-source and community-driven

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- OpenCV: For image processing and drawing
- Mediapipe: For hand tracking
- Autopy: For controlling mouse movement and clicks
- NumPy: For numerical operations

## üñ±Ô∏è Usage

To use the AI Virtual Mouse:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed (OpenCV, Mediapipe, Autopy, NumPy).

2. Run the main script:
   ```
   python AiVirtualMouse.py
   ```

3. Ensure your hand is visible to the camera, palm facing down.

4. Use the following gestures:
   - Make a fist to activate the virtual mouse
   - Move your finger to control the mouse pointer
   - Release your fist to perform a click
   - Touch thumb and forefinger to right-click
   - Touch middle finger and forefinger to left-click

5. To exit, close the GUI window or stop the script execution in your code editor.
